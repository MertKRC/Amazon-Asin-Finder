# Amazon ASIN Finder

A handsome application that can run as .exe without chrome extension to dump ASIN numbers from Amazon sellers and use it in 3rd party applications like Sellerrunning.

Since dear Amazon starts to perceive us as bots when it reaches a certain number, it can withdraw approximately 2,300-2,700 ASINs from each seller, but it is under development.

If this practice harms anyone or company, do not hesitate to contact me.
